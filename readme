high performance physics visualization

todo:

* renderer.uniform1f("time", time) instead of callbacks
* Shader uniforms setters
* reduce the number of default shaders; set special options with uniforms
* add options to: flip texCoords, sample from texture as if it was flipped

* Space to Space mapping; vec2, ivec2 variants; template parameter instead of
  Space (T.pos, T.size)
* App - keep track of window state (fullscreen / maximized / pos / ... )
* performance test: create transformation matrix on gpu for single vertex,
  emit quad from geometry shader
* custom shapes
* bezier curves
* stack allocator / vector with static buffer / flat map / general performance
* core library satellites
* App init parameters
* better cmake (finding libraries / cross-compilation)
* line width (writing code)
* replace asserts with something more robust?
* test on different platforms / gpus
* load font from ttf

included:

* catch.hpp
* dear ImGui
* glad.c glad.h
* stb_image.h

dependencies:

* glfw
* glm

compiles with gcc 7.2.0 on linux
works with OpenGL 4.5 (3.3 if some extensions are available)
