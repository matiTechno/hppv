todo:

* performance test: create transformation matrix on gpu for single vertex,
  emit quad from geometry shader
* custom shapes
* bezier curves
* stack allocator / vector with static buffer / flat map / general performance
* App init parameters
* better cmake (finding libraries / cross-compilation)
* replace asserts with something more robust?
* load font from ttf
* license

included:

* catch.hpp
